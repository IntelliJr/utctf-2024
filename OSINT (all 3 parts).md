This write-up is split into 3 parts: OSINT 1, OSINT 2, and OSINT 3.
# OSINT 1
- Solves: 202
- Points: 572
## Description
It seems like companies have document leaks all the time nowadays. I wonder if this company has any.

(NOTE: It turns out there's also an actual company named Kakuu in Japan. The real company is not in scope. Please don't try and hack them.)
#### Hints
- You're looking for a leaked document. You won't find it on their website.
- Accounts online associated with the scenario should be (fairly) distinguishable.
## Methodology
# OSINT 2
- Solves: 141
- Points: 781
## Description
Can you find where the person you identified in the first challenge lives? Flag format is City,State,Zip. For example, if they live at UT Austin submit Austin,TX,78712.

Do not include any spaces in your submission. The submission is also case sensitive, and works with or without utflag{}.
#### Hints
- Follow the storyline.
- All in scope accounts follow the same naming convention. Once you've reached a centralized location any sites you need can be reached in at most 3 clicks.
## Methodology
# OSINT 3
- Solves: 96
- Points: 890
## Description
Can you find the person's IP address? Flag format is XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
#### Hints
- If you wound up on another (unrelated) discord server, then one of the sites you visited is too new.
- All in scope accounts follow the same naming convention. Once you've reached a centralized location any sites you need can be reached in at most 3 clicks.

# Methodology analysis
A few hours at the beginning of OSINT 1 were wasted doing Google searches on the employees, which yielded no results. That is not to say that the idea was wrong - I simply was not aware of Sherlock's existence, and so discovering it was just a part of the learning process.

There was some uncertainty at the end of OSINT 3 because of the flag format given, which made it look like each part of the IP address had to be 3 digits long.
